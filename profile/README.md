Howdy! This service is no more...

Rug Pull Index was an experiement to produce transparency in emerging data markets. We crawled all of Ocean Protocol V3 on a daily basis, to rate automated market makers to rate the decentralization of liquidity provision. We actively participated in OceanDAO governance and the monthly voting - we fostered one of the first communities in the space.

However, we quickly saturated this small market and were sadly not able to expand its user base. But spiritual successors to RPI exist: The team behind RPI is still building crawlers and data pipelines! Our principles are still applied. Check: https://github.com/attestate

The rest of the page is still online, so feel free to browse around.

Best, TimDaub
